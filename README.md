This is a practice all of the HTML knowledge I have acquired. In this project, I am going to build a basic recipe website. The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. The website won’t look very pretty by the time I’ve finished. By the end of this project I would have demostrated the following skill:
1. Headings
2. Paragraphs
3. Links
4. Images
5. Line break
6. Bold and strong
7. italic and emphasized
8. Underline
9. Ordered lists
10. Unordered lists
